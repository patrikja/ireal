-- | Simple forward automatic differentiation. The main reason for supplying this
-- module rather than using one of several similar alternatives available on Hackage
-- is that they all seem to use the following implementation of differentiation of
-- products (in our notation):
--
-- x * y = mkDif (val x * val y) (df 1 x * y + x * df 1 y)
--
-- This is elegant but exponential in the order of differentiation, and hence
-- unsuitable for much of validated numerics, which often uses moderately high
-- order derivatives.
--
-- In our implementation, high order derivatives are still slow, but not as bad.
-- Derivatives of order several hundred can be handled, but in type 'Double' this is often
-- useless; rounding errors dominate the result. In type 'IReal', results are reliable, but the
-- deep nesting of the resulting expressions may lead to excessive precision requirements. Often
-- 'Data.Number.IReal.Rounded' is preferrable from an efficiency point of view.
--
-- No attempt is made to handle functions of several variables or perturbation confusion.
